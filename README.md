# netscale.py - Writtend by ChatGPT
Extracts the server name, IP and port from Netscaler cookies. 

Inspired by the work created by Catalyst256 here: https://github.com/catalyst256/Netscaler-Cookie-Decryptor/tree/master </br>
Taught ChatGPT using the verbiage in this article: https://sra.io/blog/finding-and-decoding-big-ip-and-netscaler-cookies-with-burp-suite/ </br>
Told ChatGPT to write a script that extracts the netscaler cookie and decodes it to dsiplay the underlying host name, IP and port. </br>
